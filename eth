"Ethereum code" can refer to either the underlying code of the Ethereum network itself, found in projects like the Go-Ethereum (Geth) implementation on GitHub, or to code written for the network, such as Solidity smart contracts for applications like tokens (e.g., ERC-20 tokens) and decentralized applications (dApps). A common misunderstanding is confusing the Ethereum network's code with a trading platform named Ethereum Code, which is a separate, non-related automated trading bot.
